You can find that the index.php in our article directory has been deleted.

Code Analysis

Corresponding to the following code in admin_files.php

```java
elseif($action=='del')
{
	if($filedir == '')
	{
		ShowMsg('未指定要删除的文件或文件名不合法', '-1');
		exit();
	}
	if(substr(strtolower($filedir),0,$dirlen)!=$dirTemplate){
		ShowMsg("只允许删除附件目录内的文件！","admin_files.php");
		exit;
	}
	$folder=substr($filedir,0,strrpos($filedir,'/'));
	if(!is_dir($folder)){
		ShowMsg("目录不存在！","admin_files.php");
		exit;
	}
	unlink($filedir);
	ShowMsg("操作成功！","admin_files.php?path=".$folder);
	exit;
}
```

Although our directory is checked, we can still bypass it by directory traversal, and there is no restriction on the type of file operations we can perform, resulting in the deletion of arbitrary files that can cause system paralysis.
