# Hi there, I'm Jialin Liao (廖家林) 👋

[cite_start]I'm a passionate and self-driven Information Security student from Chengdu University of Information Technology[cite: 7]. My expertise lies in Offensive Security, Code Auditing, and Security Tool Development. I thrive on solving complex security challenges and enjoy contributing to the community through open-source projects and technical articles.

### 🚀 What I Do

-   [cite_start]**Penetration Testing & Red Teaming**: Experienced in full-lifecycle penetration testing, from web application security (OWASP Top 10, Business Logic Flaws) [cite: 15] [cite_start]to internal network penetration (Active Directory, Lateral Movement)[cite: 19]. [cite_start]Proven success in multiple red team exercises, achieving **1st place in the "Huxiang Cup" 2025**.

-   [cite_start]**Code Auditing & Vulnerability Research**: Proficient in white-box auditing for Java/PHP applications using tools like CodeQL[cite: 17]. [cite_start]I have independently discovered and been credited with multiple CVEs (e.g., CVE-2024-48112, CVE-2024-44921).

-   **Security Development**: I build tools to empower security operations. My projects include:
    -   [cite_start][**AI-API-Fuzzer**](https://github.com/nn0nkey/AI-API-Fuzzer): An intelligent fuzzer that leverages LLMs to discover hidden APIs.
    -   [cite_start][**Godzilla_nnonkey**](https://github.com/nn0nkey/Godzilla_nnonkey): An enhanced version of the Godzilla webshell with advanced evasion capabilities[cite: 66, 67].
    -   [cite_start][**Fofa-MCP**](https://github.com/nn0nkey/Fofa-MCP): An asset discovery tool based on the MCP framework[cite: 61, 62].

-   [cite_start]**Emerging Tech Security**: Actively exploring security in new domains, including **Cloud-Native Security** (Docker, Kubernetes)  [cite_start]and **AI Security** (Prompt Injection, LLM-based attacks)[cite: 22].
